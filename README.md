First and foremost step of data analysis is to look at the data. I downloaded the file and tried to look at the fields and see what kind of data I have been given. The dataset is called as "2017-fordgobike-tripdata" has following fields: 


Trip Duration (seconds)

Start Time and Date

End Time and Date

Start Station ID

Start Station Name

Start Station Latitude

Start Station Longitude

End Station ID

End Station Name

End Station Latitude

End Station Longitude

Bike ID

User Type (Subscriber or Customer – “Subscriber” = Member or “Customer” = Casual)

Member Year of Birth

Member Gender

The next step is to reasearch a bit on bike-share and understand what bike share business is about and how it works. Ford go bike is a company that provides on-demand bike rentals for customers in the bay area, that through San Francisco and San Jose. Users can unlock bikes from a variety of stations throughout each city, and return them to any station within the listed cities, thus making it a good option for one-way trips. People use bike share to commute to work or school, run errands, get to appointments or social engagements and more. It's a fun, convenient and affordable way to get around.

The bikes are available for use 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, 365 days/year and riders have access to all bikes in the network when they become a member or purchase a pass. 

Three pass options are available:
1. Single Ride: One ride up to 30 minutes. Perfect for quick, one-way trips.


2. Access Pass: Explore the city with unlimited 30-minute trips in a 24-hour period.


3. Monthly Membership: Unlimited 45-minute trips for the whole month.


4. Yearly Membership: Unlimited 45-minute trips for the whole year.

As given by you, these are first and foremost analysis that I also thought of:

- Average, standard deviation, general distribution of trip duration


- What are the busiest dates and times?


- What are the most common starting and end stations?


- User population descriptions

## Aditional insights:

Apart from these some of the following insights I would like to know from the data but for these I would need some additional data points such as user id to get specific information particularly for a specific user:

- Which users are more likely to pay for yearly subscription?

- Which users are more likely to buy single rides or 24 hour passes? 

By looking for the insights above we could have a better idea of the composition of customers which will help the company put improve the marketing strategy accordingly and also come up with better commercials and market promotions which would increase the sale.

Also looking at the following insights would help us in understanding the using pattern of bikes with respect to each city which can help the company to distribute their resources more efficiently. 

- How does the use of bikes vary by cities? For example, do users in some cities prefer longer trips to shorter ones than users in other cities? 


- How many bikes are needed for each city?
